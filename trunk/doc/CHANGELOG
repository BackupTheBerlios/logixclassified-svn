Set footer.php instead of footer.inc.php
Created new logo (temporarily) until I can get some decent templates done
Cleaned up index.php and main.php for E_NOTICE and E_WARNINGS
Added coding standards html page to docs
All main pages (non logged in users) have NOTICES and WARNINGS mostly all cleaned up.
added timer class file
added scratch dir and time log functions
Built main.php with smarty templates and ran benchmarks- Contrary to what I expected based on theory, smarty is *faster*
even though it uses more memory, it uses more memory for a *shorter period of time*
Decision: Convert the whole thing to smarty.
Added in settings class
Added in mysql class with bind variables
Added in benchmark class extending timer class

updated credits page to reflect additions and borrowed code.
