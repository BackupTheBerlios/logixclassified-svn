OK I converted index to use smarty, this is much more identical:
Results of index.php ab after smarty
(Note the very slight difference in transfer rate, which is perfectly in line with the before page, so adding smarty did very little to affect
this page. )

Damn! This is amazing. Memory usage on main.php is only 200 K larger than before with smarty in place, and GET THIS:
apachebench results benchmark *faster* !!
(Guess why? Smarty caches Whee!)

July 1 - ran same bench test as below, but on a different domain , to avoid hitting mod_perl and MasonHQ
(candlealternatives.com)
Server was running awstats at the time, so I will repeat after letting it cool off..
(however pages were served at Requests per second:    6.79 [#/sec] (mean))
OK looks like 6 requests per second is about as good as it gets on this box - at least while those kids are hammering on the games

July 1 - Running 500x on a plain html file instead to compare performance of script vs. html
What I did- view source of teh same classified.php file, copy source to make class.html
Server load results about the same as test below.
Actually server load was falling during this test, did not increase load at all.just goes to show the huge difference between html and php
Even though, I have .html file set to be parsed through Mason (for perl development) which obviously would slow down html pages.

Load spiked from 1.31 to 2.87 (it had just finished a run of awstats)   still piss poor.

July 1 - 500x on guestbook.php
Server load start 0.60  spiked to max of 0.84
Possibly the slow times are due to my own connection bottleneck form my local PC. I'll have to repeat
tests from another server with big enough pipes to handle lots of traffic

on July 1 I ran 500 x apachebench on main.php
Server load notes: During monitoring, I noted server load 1.08 at start , spiked to as high as 3.65
Probably due to activity on one of the games running there, but that makes for a somewhat real-world test
This test was only 500 requests, and took 93 seconds- totally piss-poor performance.
We should be able to handle 1,000 requests in 10 seconds - That is the goal.
